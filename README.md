The [Microsoft Foundry catalog](https://ai.azure.com/catalog) has thousands of models from Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI, xAI, Hugging Face, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, and NVIDIA - and new releases land almost daily. Keeping up is one thing. Knowing what a release actually does *differently*, and whether it's the right pick for your agent, is another.

That's what this repo is for:

1. **Catching up?** The [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) has every announcement in one place.
2. **Want to try one?** Browse [models/](./models/) for a release *capsule* - a runnable notebook that shows you what it does.
3. **Can't find the one you need?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/model-releases/issues/new) and we'll backfill it.

<br/>

## Changelog: What's New In Foundry Models?

Every new model release announcement gets a row here, with a link back to the original post plus the publisher and capabilities at a glance. The three most recent:

<!-- BEGIN:RECENTLY-ADDED -->
| Model | Release date | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **aug-2026** | [2026-08-19](https://aka.ms/modelrouter/updates) | Model Router · Chat Completion · Function Calling |
| **MAI-Thinking-1** | [2026-08-12](https://microsoft.ai/news/introducing-mai-thinking-1) | Reasoning · Chat Completion · Function Calling · Long Context |
| **MAI-Code-1.1-Flash** | [2026-08-11](https://microsoft.ai/news/mai-code-1-1-flash-br-better-faster-at-a-quarter-of-the-cost) | Chat Completion |
<!-- END:RECENTLY-ADDED -->

*See the full* [*CHANGELOG*](./CHANGELOG.md) *for everything else.*

## Capsule: What Can I Do With This Release?

An announcement tells you a model exists. It doesn't tell you what it's like to use. So each capsule pairs the release with a notebook you can run - practical use cases, code-first - to show you:
- What *tasks* the publisher's models are good at
- What *new features* this release brings
- What *tradeoffs* it makes on cost, quality, and latency

Start with the [Quickstart](#quickstart-explore-model-releases-hands-on), then pick one:

<!-- BEGIN:RECENT-CAPSULES -->
| Capsule | Last updated | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Model Router — August 2026](models/model-router/aug-2026/) | 2026-08-21 | Catch up on routing modes, model subsets, deployment types, failover, and agentic routing as optimization levers |
| [MAI-Voice-2](models/microsoft-ai/mai-voice-2/) | 2026-08-19 | Direct expressive, multilingual, and long-form speech synthesis |
| [MAI-Image-2.5](models/microsoft-ai/mai-image-2.5/) | 2026-08-11 | Generate and edit images from text prompts |
<!-- END:RECENT-CAPSULES -->

*See the full* [*CAPSULE-TOC*](./CAPSULE-TOC.md) *for everything else.*

<br/>

## Quickstart: Explore Model Releases Hands-on

Want to run a capsule notebook? Four steps, and the first two are one-time setup:

1. **Open in GitHub Codespaces** - you get a ready-to-run environment, no local install.
2. **Do the [quickstart](./models/quickstart/)** once, to set up a Foundry project and your `.env`.
3. **Pick a capsule** - `models/` is organized by provider, then release. Ex: `models/microsoft-ai/mai-image-2.5/`.
4. **Open its notebook in VS Code**, select the kernel, and run.

Each notebook is yours to break - change the prompts, swap the inputs, and try it against your own scenario.
