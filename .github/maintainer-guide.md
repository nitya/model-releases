# Maintainer guide

Everything you need to keep `model-releases` healthy: how the repo is
wired together, how to add your first artifact end-to-end, and how to
test that changes don't drift from the spec.

Companion documents:

- [`.github/plan.md`](./plan.md) — the living design plan.
- [`.github/specs/schemas/`](./specs/schemas/) — JSON Schemas that every
  artifact's YAML frontmatter is validated against.
- [`.github/agents/CapsuleCreatorAgent.md`](./agents/CapsuleCreatorAgent.md) —
  the Copilot custom agent that drives capsule creation.
- [`.github/skills/`](./skills/) — the six spec-driven skills the agent
  orchestrates.

---

## 1. Quickstart — validate the setup and add your first *something*

Do these five steps once, in order, on any fresh clone.

### 1.1 Open the devcontainer

The `.devcontainer/` config installs Python 3.12, Azure CLI, GitHub CLI,
`azd`, `marp-cli`, `uv`, and everything in `requirements-dev.txt`. Reopen
in container from VS Code, or run the post-create script manually.

### 1.2 Install spec-validation deps

```bash
pip install pyyaml jsonschema
```

(Only needed if you skipped the devcontainer.)

### 1.3 Run the spec validator — expect all green

```bash
python scripts/validate-specs.py
```

You should see one `✓` line per artifact and a final `N/N artifacts
valid.` If anything fails, fix the frontmatter before doing anything
else — schema drift compounds fast.

### 1.4 Bootstrap `.env` from the template

```bash
./scripts/setenv.sh                                # copy sample.env → .env
./scripts/setenv.sh <resource-group> <project>     # + populate via Azure CLI
```

Details in [`scripts/setenv.spec.md`](../scripts/setenv.spec.md).

### 1.5 Add your first artifact

Pick the smallest thing that exercises the flow, then work up:

| Want to add | Use | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| A **glossary term** you noticed missing | [`add-to-glossary`](./skills/add-to-glossary/SKILL.md) | Entry in `docs/GLOSSARY.md` under the right letter section |
| A **new model publisher** | [`add-publisher`](./skills/add-publisher/SKILL.md) | `models/<slug>/README.md` |
| A **model** in an existing publisher (no capsule yet) | [`add-model`](./skills/add-model/SKILL.md) | Row in `models/<publisher>/README.md` |
| A **full release capsule** | [`CapsuleCreatorAgent`](./agents/CapsuleCreatorAgent.md) → [`add-capsule`](./skills/add-capsule/SKILL.md) | Capsule folder + 1–N notebooks + CHANGELOG row + Recently added refresh |
| A **new capability** in the taxonomy | [`add-capability-doc`](./skills/add-capability-doc/SKILL.md) | Primer under `docs/primers/` + row in repo README taxonomy |

**Suggested first exercise (5 minutes):** run `add-to-glossary` to add
one term. It touches only `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, has clear success criteria,
and lets you see the "creator asks → skill produces → validator confirms"
loop end-to-end.

Then re-run:

```bash
python scripts/validate-specs.py
```

Still all green? The setup is working.

                       ▼
              scripts/validate-specs.py
```

Everything the agent produces is a plain Markdown file. The YAML
frontmatter at the top of each file is what makes it "spec-driven": each
file declares its `kind:` and is validated against the matching schema.

See [`plan.md` §14](./plan.md#14-authoring-approach--spec-driven-lightweight)
for why we chose Markdown + YAML over a heavier framework, and the
upgrade path to GitHub Spec Kit later.

## 3. Routine maintenance tasks

### 3.1 A new release drops

1. Open a session with the `CapsuleCreatorAgent`.
2. The agent asks for publisher, model, release date, capability tags,
   pricing, expiry, model card + docs + sample references
   (**required**), 1–3 target domains, and a list of teaching concepts
   (each notebook covers 1–3 concepts).
3. The agent invokes `add-publisher` / `add-model` / `add-capsule` /
   `refresh-recent-activity` in order.
4. Run `python scripts/validate-specs.py` — must be all green.
5. Skim the generated capsule README + notebooks for the voice/hype
   rules ([`plan.md` §15](./plan.md#15-content-authoring--pedagogy-rules)).
6. PR, review, merge.

### 3.2 A model is retiring

Add the date to the **Expires** column of that model's row in the
publisher README members table (`add-model` takes an `expires` input
for this). That table is the single place a retirement date is
tracked — the repo README and the CHANGELOG deliberately don't carry
one, so there is nothing to regenerate.

### 3.3 Monthly refresh

Run `refresh-recent-activity` once a month (or wire it up via a
scheduled GitHub Action) to keep the "Recently added" table current
even if no capsule shipped that month.

### 3.4 Glossary — adding a new term

Use `add-to-glossary`. The glossary is read by the developer/learner audience,
so authoring rules live here rather than on the page itself. Rules for every
entry:

- **On demand only** — add a term when it first shows up in a capsule, notebook,
  or primer, or on user request. Do not pre-populate.
- Filed under the correct **letter section**, alphabetized within it, as a
  level-3 heading (`### Term`) so it gets a stable kebab-case anchor.
- Lead with the **developer question** the term answers, in italics under the
  heading (e.g. *"Do I need the biggest model for every request?"*).
- **2–4 sentences**, in the repo content voice — clear, concrete, no marketing
  buzz. See the style guide expectations in the content you write.
- **Cross-link related terms** with in-page anchors so the glossary reads as a
  connected narrative, not a list of isolated definitions.
- **At least one grounding reference**, ideally on `learn.microsoft.com`; fall
  back to the provider's official docs only when Learn does not yet cover the
  term. One citation is a single `**Reference:**` line; two or more use a
  bulleted list under `**Reference:**`.

### 3.5 A new capability shows up

Use `add-capability-doc`. This:

- Adds a primer under `docs/primers/<slug>.md`.
- Adds a row to the repo README **Capability taxonomy** table.
- Extends the `capabilities` enum in
  [`capsule.schema.json`](./specs/schemas/capsule.schema.json) so future
  capsules can tag themselves with it — confirm this schema change in
  review.

### 3.6 Renaming a publisher or model

Slugs appear in three places: the folder path, `publisher:`/`model:`
frontmatter fields, and cross-references in the repo README + CHANGELOG.
Do the rename in a single PR, then run the validator and grep for the
old slug:

```bash
grep -RIn "<old-slug>" .
python scripts/validate-specs.py
```

---

## 4. Testing strategy

The whole point of the spec-driven layout is that most "tests" are just
schema conformance. Here's the layered approach.

### Layer 1 — Spec validation (fast, deterministic)

```bash
python scripts/validate-specs.py
```

Walks every `models/**/README.md`, `docs/primers/*.md`,
`.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.github/agents/*.md`, and
`scripts/*.spec.md`, matches it to a `kind:`, and validates against the
JSON Schema.

**Wire it into CI** as the very first check. If schemas drift or someone
edits frontmatter by hand and breaks a shape, this catches it in
seconds.

### Layer 2 — Structural checks (Markdown well-formedness)

Grep-based invariants that keep the repo internally consistent:

- **Marker block present in repo README:**
  ```bash
  grep -q "BEGIN:RECENTLY-ADDED"  README.md
  ```
- **Every capsule README ends with `## References`:**
  ```bash
  for f in models/*/*/README.md; do
    grep -q "^## References" "$f" || echo "MISSING References: $f"
  done
  ```
- **Every notebook has a `Your Turn to Explore` cell:**
  ```bash
  for nb in models/*/*/*.ipynb; do
    grep -q "Your Turn to Explore" "$nb" || echo "MISSING YTTE: $nb"
  done
  ```
- **Notebook granularity** — no notebook lists more than 3 concepts in
  its capsule frontmatter (schema enforces `maxItems: 3` on
  `notebooks[].concepts`, but a grep on generated ToCs is a cheap
  double-check).

Package these as a shell script (`scripts/check-structure.sh`) when
they start to bite; keep them ad-hoc until then.

### Layer 3 — Voice and grounding lint

Cheap ripgrep passes catch drift in the two rules we care about most.

**Banned marketing phrases** (see [`plan.md` §15](./plan.md#15-content-authoring--pedagogy-rules)):

```bash
rg -i --glob '!.github/plan.md' --glob '!.github/agents/*' --glob '!.github/maintainer-guide.md' \
  -e 'revolutionary|game-changing|game changer|unlocks?|supercharge' \
  -e 'seamless|cutting-edge|best-in-class|state-of-the-art' \
  -e 'powerful|effortless(ly)?' \
  README.md CHANGELOG.md docs/ models/
```

Expected: no matches outside the plan/agent/guide files that legitimately
name them.

**Brand rule** — never "Azure AI Foundry" (Learn URLs containing
`foundry` are fine):

```bash
rg -n 'Azure AI Foundry' -- README.md CHANGELOG.md docs/ models/ .github/ scripts/
```

Expected: zero matches.

**Grounding rule** — every "Learn more" section links to
`learn.microsoft.com` (fallbacks OK when noted):

```bash
rg -n '^## Learn more' -A 20 docs/primers/ | rg -v 'learn\.microsoft\.com'
```

Expected: only the section headings and blank lines; every bullet
should carry a Learn URL.

### Layer 4 — Notebook execution smoke test (opt-in per capsule)

Notebook validation is opt-in because capsules require real Foundry
deployments + credentials. The recommended pattern for a capsule
maintainer:

1. Populate `.env` via `scripts/setenv.sh`.
2. From the capsule folder:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace notebooks/*.ipynb
   ```
3. If the env-precheck cell fails, the whole notebook stops — that's
   the whole point of the precheck. Fix `.env` and rerun.

Do **not** run these in CI by default (cost + secrets). Instead:

- Manual pre-merge check for capsule PRs.
- Optional monthly job that executes the top-3 recent-activity
  notebooks against a shared test project, with credentials injected
  from GitHub Actions secrets.

### Layer 5 — validation wiring

The real workflow is
[`.github/workflows/validate.yml`](./workflows/validate.yml). It runs
on **pull requests** and on demand, but not on push — so CI stays off
every individual commit and the `validate` job is the merge gate. Mark
it as a required status check in branch protection, or a red run is
only advisory.

Locally, the pre-commit hook
([`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../.pre-commit-config.yaml)) is what
catches problems before they reach the PR. Both run the same
entrypoint:

```bash
python scripts/validate.py           # schemas + crosslinks + generated files
python scripts/validate.py --watch   # interactive: re-run on every save
python scripts/validate.py --fix     # regenerate stale generated files
```

Voice rules — no hype words, always **Microsoft Foundry** — are **not**
automated. They are reviewer-enforced through the checklist in
[`pull_request_template.md`](./pull_request_template.md). A naive
grep would flag legitimate strings such as the
`azure-ai-foundry-blog` URL path, so treat any future automation as a
Layer 2/3 check that has to exclude link targets.

## 5. When to change the schemas

The JSON Schemas are the load-bearing contract. Change them when:

- You add a **new capability** (extends `capabilities` enum in
  `capsule.schema.json`) — happens via `add-capability-doc`.
- You add a **new artifact kind** — add
  `<kind>.schema.json`, register it in `scripts/validate-specs.py`
  `KIND_GLOBS`, and document it in `plan.md`.
- You want to **tighten a rule** (e.g. make `announcement` required,
  add `format: uri` somewhere). Run the validator immediately after —
  every existing artifact must pass or you have work to do.

Don't change schemas without also updating the corresponding skill(s)
that produce those artifacts, or the agent will happily produce invalid
frontmatter.

---

## 6. Common pitfalls

- **Editing generated files without touching frontmatter.** Fine for
  prose. If you change structure (add/remove sections the schema cares
  about), also update the frontmatter and re-validate.
- **Forgetting the marker blocks.** `refresh-recent-activity` rewrites
  content *between* `<!-- BEGIN:X --> … <!-- END:X -->`. If those
  markers are missing from the repo README, the skill silently no-ops.
- **`.env` in git.** `*.env` is gitignored. If you see one staged, stop
  and unstage it — the sample template is `scripts/sample.env`.
- **Slugs with underscores or spaces.** Everything is kebab-case. The
  publisher/model regex in `capsule.schema.json` will reject anything else.
- **Notebook that grew past 3 concepts.** Split it. The schema
  (`notebooks[].concepts` has `maxItems: 3`) will reject it, but it's
  cheaper to split during authoring than after review.

## 8. Reviewing a manual (non-agent) contribution

Contributors can hand-author capsules and CHANGELOG entries without
going through the agent. Two safety nets catch most mistakes for you:

- **`scripts/validate.py`** — one command that runs the schema
  validator, the crosslink validator, and the generated-file check.
  Run it before committing, or leave `--watch` running while you
  edit. The pre-commit hook runs the same command, and the
  `Validate contribution` workflow runs it on every pull request,
  where it gates the merge. Between them they enforce:
  - Frontmatter matches the schema for its kind
  - Every capsule has a matching `CHANGELOG.md` row (date + model)
  - Every CHANGELOG row is exactly four cells wide
  - Every capsule is listed in its publisher README
  - Every capability tag has a matching `docs/primers/<slug>.md`
  - Every `related_primers` entry names a real primer slug
  - `README.md` Recently added top 3 = `CHANGELOG.md` top 3
  - Generated files (`catalog.json`, `llms.txt`, `CAPSULE-TOC.md`) are current
  - No `_review_` placeholders remain in learner-facing files
- **PR template** — [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./pull_request_template.md)
  gives contributors a checklist per change type (capsule, publisher,
  primer, glossary, CHANGELOG-only). Anything unchecked in a section
  the PR touches is a signal for the reviewer.

That leaves you to eyeball the things machines can't check:

- **Pedagogy.** Action-focused voice ("You'll deploy…"), 1–3 concepts
  per notebook, alternating markdown ↔ code, and mandatory `Your Turn
  to Explore` / `Summary` / `References` cells at the end.
- **Tone.** No hype words ("revolutionary", "game-changing"…), no
  marketing adjectives, and always **Microsoft Foundry** (never "Azure
  AI Foundry").
- **Grounding.** Learner-facing links point to `learn.microsoft.com`
  when a canonical Learn page exists; provider docs are a fallback.
- **Pricing.** Not tracked in the CHANGELOG or the README. Rates
  change by region, tier, and deployment type, so a frozen figure goes
  stale silently. A capsule points at the model card for price.

Run every check with one command before pushing:

```bash
python scripts/validate.py
```

Leave it running while you draft, so each save re-checks:

```bash
python scripts/validate.py --watch
```

or install the pre-commit hooks to have it run on every commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
```
